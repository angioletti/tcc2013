  abstract = {A new psychophysical experimental method is proposed for estimating
	image quality. The method comprises two steps; the first step is
	a 'categorical session' and the second step is a 'triplet comparison
	session' which is newly developed for this purpose. The triplet comparison
	method is developed, in order to improve the assessment accuracy
	and repeatability, without imposing excess observer stress during
	the visual assessment. Moreover, since the triplet comparison inevitably
	reduces the number of comparisons, experimenter can design psychophysical
	experiments using a higher number of samples, compared to the paired
	comparison method. A series of psychophysical experiments were conducted
	and performed. It is found that the proposed method gives reliable
	and stable results so far examined.},
